### Genreal Documentation
All game functions are written in Javascript, using the [PIXI.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) web graphics environment  

### What went right
I'm very happy with how the console segment turned out, it implements user input memory (use up and down arrows to access past entries)
and stores it in local storage. 

### What went wrong
My biggest issue is that I was unable to get sound working in my program, as I was unable to find any APIs that would work.  

Another issue I have is with the level system. Currently, I have no elegant solution to building levels, it relies on me specifying x
and y coordinates of objects in the level. If I had more time available, I would like to add an easier level builder.

### Possible Improvements
As stated before, the number 1 improvement I would make is the level builder. Having an easy way to place level objects would give me
the ability to add more content to the game.
